## Purpose 
### The purpose of this analysis is to propose a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, IA. Below we will look at Bike Sharing Data for the city of NYC to better see the statistics for Bike Sharing. 
### Results
* The first graph shows a breakdown of active riders by Gender. There is almost three times the amount of male riders for female riders. 
* The next graph shows the checkout times for Users. Most checkouts occur within the first 20 minutes. 
* The third graph represents the checkout times for users broken down by Gender. The peak for male riders occurs at 5 minutes with a peak for female users occurring at 6 minutes. 
* This heatmap shows the trips by Weekday per hour. A first peak occurs between 6am-9am while the second peak occurs between 5pm-7pm on weekdays. Where the bike usage during weekends is more consistent from 11am to about 7pm. 
* The next graph represents the trips by weekday by hour. Here we see the data broken down by users' gender. The peak hours for male riders and female riders are very consistent. 
* The sixth graph shows the usertypes broken down for each day of the week. There is more users that are subscribers that use the bikes than customers. 
* This last graph shows our peak hours for the month of August with two peaks occurring in the morning and the early evening. 
### Summary
* The first key takeout that can be taken from our analysis is that there is a great need for bikesharing in cities where people commute. As seen below, there is two clear peaks of usage during 7am-9am illustrating that people rely on bike sharing to get to work. With a second peak occurring right after work hours. In addition, people consistently ride the bikes during the weekends.

* Another important take away from this data is that most daily bike users are subscribers and not just occasional customers. This is important in demonstrating that most of the users are returing subscribers. By creating an incentive for the subscribers, we can ensure that there are consistent bikes being used.
